# search_words
Requirements:
User Input: The script will prompt users for:

A word or a sequence of words.
An option to specify whether they want to search:
a. Within filenames.
b. Inside the file content.
Search Operation:

If the user chooses to search within filenames, the script will look for files with names that contain the user-inputted word(s).
If the user chooses to search inside file content, the script will search inside the files for the specified word(s).
Implementation: The tool will be developed using Python's Streamlit library for a web-based interface.

Proposed Streamlit App Structure:
Text Input Box: Where users will enter the word or sequence of words.
Dropdown or Radio Selection: Where users will specify if they want to search in filenames or file content.
Button: To trigger the search operation.
Output Area: Displaying the search results.
